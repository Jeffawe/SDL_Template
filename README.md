<h1>SDL Test Project</h1>
<p>Welcome to my SDL Test Project repository. This project serves as a sandbox for testing various features and functionalities using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and SDL_image. The current implementation includes a basic gravity ball simulation, with plans to add more test features in the future.</p>
<br>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this repository is to experiment with SDL and SDL_image, exploring their capabilities and building small test examples to understand their usage better.</p>
<br> 

<h2>Installation</h2>
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository:
  
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SDLTestProject.git

- Navigate to the project directory:

      cd SDLTestProject

- Set up SDL and SDL_image:
  - Ensure that you have SDL and SDL_image installed on your system. You can download them from the SDL website and follow the installation instructions for your platform.
<br> 

- Open the solution file (SDLTestProject.sln) in Visual Studio.
<br> 

- Set up the include and library directories for SDL and SDL_image in your Visual Studio project settings:
  - Include directories: Add the path to the SDL and SDL_image include folders.
  - Library directories: Add the path to the SDL and SDL_image library folders.
<br> 

- Build the project in Visual Studio and run the executable. You should see the gravity ball simulation in action.
<br> 
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>After building and running the project, you can observe the gravity ball simulation. Additional features and test examples will be added incrementally.</p>
