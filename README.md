SDL Test Project
Welcome to my SDL Test Project repository. This project serves as a sandbox for testing various features and functionalities using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and SDL_image. The current implementation includes a basic gravity ball simulation, with plans to add more test features in the future.

Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to experiment with SDL and SDL_image, exploring their capabilities and building small test examples to understand their usage better.

Features
Gravity Ball Simulation: A simple example demonstrating gravity and motion using SDL.
SDL_image Integration: Utilizes SDL_image for handling image loading and rendering.
Expandable: The project is designed to be a playground for testing additional features in SDL.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SDLTestProject.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd SDLTestProject
Set up SDL and SDL_image:

Ensure that you have SDL and SDL_image installed on your system. You can download them from the SDL website and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

Open the project in Visual Studio:

Open the solution file (SDLTestProject.sln) in Visual Studio.

Configure include and library directories:

Set up the include and library directories for SDL and SDL_image in your Visual Studio project settings:

Include directories: Add the path to the SDL and SDL_image include folders.
Library directories: Add the path to the SDL and SDL_image library folders.
Build and run the project:

Build the project in Visual Studio and run the executable. You should see the gravity ball simulation in action.

Usage
After building and running the project, you can observe the gravity ball simulation. Additional features and test examples will be added incrementally.
