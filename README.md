This project serves as a sandbox for testing various features and functionalities using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and SDL_image. The current implementation includes a basic gravity ball simulation, with plans to add more test features in the future.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to experiment with SDL and SDL_image, exploring their capabilities and building small test examples to understand their usage better.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SDLTestProject.git`
- Navigate to the project directory:
  `cd SDLTestProject`
- Set up SDL and SDL_image:
  Ensure that you have SDL and SDL_image installed on your system. You can download them from the [SDL website](https://www.libsdl.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your platform.
- Open the solution file (SDLTestProject.sln) in Visual Studio.
- Set up the include and library directories for SDL and SDL_image in your Visual Studio project settings:
  - Include directories: Add the path to the SDL and SDL_image include folders.
  - Library directories: Add the path to the SDL and SDL_image library folders.
- Build the project in Visual Studio and run the executable. You should see the gravity ball simulation in action.

## Usage
After building and running the project, you can observe the gravity ball simulation. Additional features and test examples will be added incrementally.
